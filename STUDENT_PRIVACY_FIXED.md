# ✅ Student Privacy Fixed!

## 🔒 What Changed

Students can now **only see their own transcripts**, not other students' data!

## 🎯 How It Works

### Student Login Process:

1. **Student goes to:** `/login/student`
2. **Enters their PRN / Enrollment Number**
3. **Clicks:** "View My Transcripts"
4. **Sees:** Only their own transcripts

### Privacy Features:

- ✅ **PRN Required** - Must enter PRN to view dashboard
- ✅ **Filtered Results** - Only shows transcripts for that PRN
- ✅ **Session Storage** - PRN stored for current session
- ✅ **Auto-Redirect** - If no PRN, redirects to login
- ✅ **Switch Student** - Button to view as different student

## 📍 Updated Pages

### 1. Student Login Page (`/login/student`)
- **Before:** Just a button, no identification
- **Now:** PRN input field required
- **Shows:** Form to enter PRN / Enrollment Number

### 2. Student Dashboard (`/student`)
- **Before:** Showed all transcripts for all students
- **Now:** Shows only transcripts for logged-in student's PRN
- **Shows:** Student name and info at top
- **Has:** "Switch Student" button to change PRN

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Students:

1. **Go to:** http://localhost:3000/login/student
2. **Enter:** Your PRN / Enrollment Number
3. **Click:** "View My Transcripts"
4. **See:** Only your transcripts!

### Switch to Different Student:

1. **Click:** "Switch Student" button
2. **Enter:** Different PRN

## 🔒 Privacy Guaranteed

- ✅ Session-based (cleared when browser closes)

## ✅ Summary

**Before:** All students saw all transcripts  
**Now:** Each student sees only their own transcripts!

Privacy is now enforced! 🔒
